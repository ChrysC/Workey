Have the defaults not be time sensitive.

Sean enters the following:

Date (selects date), Name (Drop Down), Start Time (input - Parses regular and military time), Schedule (Graphical Drop Down).

Take the start time, and count the number of o's from 12:00 to the start time (for instance, there are 16 o's before 8AM). Create schedule string by inserting schedule at start time. Append o's till 12:00.


create a time tracker which highlights the current hour/time.

Update the way the half-hours are displayed to do a gradient shift half way through the hour if the schedule is a half hour schedule. Meaning the box would go green-blue in one hour segment if the person goes from phones to chats.

Put a row for the times under the bar in which a person is working, so it would be like: P - P / :00 - :30. Or do like a ruler at the top/bottom of the cell which has an indicator in the middle for the half hour. Could be awesome if there's a line over everything which increments every 5 minutes for the new time... kind of like a play-progress cursor in red.
